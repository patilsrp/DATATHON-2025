# Predicting Customer Churn in Subscription-Based E-Learning Services

This repository provides a machine learning-driven system for predicting customer churn in subscription-based e-learning services. By analyzing user behavior, engagement levels, and sentiment analysis, this system helps identify at-risk customers, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Features

- **Customer Behavior Analysis**  
   - Tracks and analyzes user interactions, course completions, and session durations.
   - Identifies key behavioral patterns correlated with customer retention and churn.

- **Engagement & Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Implements NLP techniques to analyze customer feedback and sentiment from reviews.
   - Transformer used is BERT.

- **Predictive Churn Model**  
   - Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn based on historical data.
   - Models include Catboost and XGBoost.

- **Feature Engineering & Optimization**  
   - Optimizes model performance with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.
   - Generates insights and recommendations for reducing churn.
